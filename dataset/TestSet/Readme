The dataset contains the benchmark data for a class of scheduling problems with time/sequence-dependent setup times and time windows. It includes a real-world multi-orbit agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem, and an order acceptance and scheduling problem. The source code of the algorithm ALNS/TPF is also included.

The dataset towards MO-AEOSSP, which contains various-size instances for training and test, toghther with the source code are contained. Instances of 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 200 requests are organized into groups in the repository, 30 instances for each scale. Different instances are denoted by “Size\_NO.”, where “Size” is the number of input requests in this instance and “NO.” is the index. For example, “100\_1” means the first instance of the 100-request MO-AEOSSP.  

Here we provide the instances with the format of both npy and xlsx, where each npy file contains 30 instances for a specific instance size while each xlsx file contains one specific instance.
